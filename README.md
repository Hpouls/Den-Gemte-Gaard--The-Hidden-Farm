# ThisIsTheRightVersionOfDenGemteGaard

## Description
**This project is a *Pain Distraction* game that is aimed towards children that undergo venipuncture procedures.**
Here they are tasked with finding a farmers lost animals using their spacial awareness and listening for the animals sounds.

The goal with this game was to distract the patients with an interactive experience that would not limit their vision via only utilizing audio and a Wii remote.
 Making use of the *"Unity Wii Remote API"* (see: Wii-README), the project successfully allows the user to locate and find the animals using  the remote.

## Usage
Requirements for this project to work on any computer are:

Multiple speakers - Up to three and a minimum of two seperate speakers 

Wii remote - Including a Wii sensorbar (or equivilant).

Dolphin Emulator - Software that lets a Wii remote connect to a PC via bluetooth.

## Collaboration
This project was made as a student project at Aalborg University Copenhagen (AAU) for the Bachelor in Medialogy.
A small team of six students behind the project successfully created the project using Unity as the priamry game engine.

Further more the project was made in correlation with another group of six students from medialogy.
The goal for this other group, or sister group, was the same. One key difference was the use of Virtual Reality to help in distracting from the venipuncture procedure.
